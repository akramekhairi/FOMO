# FOMO
 
A cross-platform mobile application built with React Native that aims to streamline community and organization events on the New York Abu Dhabi campus by allowing users and organizers alike to easily find, register, and create events occuring on campus. Furthermore, the experience is personalized for each user and they are recommended events based on their memberships, preferences, and previously attended events.

Users can swipe through NYUAD campus events on their home page and like, share, or RSVP for an event seamlessly. Users can also view who's attending the event before registering for it.

Furthermore, community members and student organizations can create events on the mobile application. Users can search for events as well as edit their profile to change their personal information, organization memberships and events they plan on attending.
